Before running docker-compose.yml needs to build a jar file with Gradle bootJar command.
After starting application you will have a default person with email "admin@mail.com", password "password"
and role "admin". Also, you will have default client with client-id "base-client" and client-secret
"base-client-secret". This person and client give you access to client endpoints.
